# Beep Boop Machine

#### A form input that returns robot speak, 10.27.17

#### By **Cheryl Frankenfield**

## Description

_With this project, I created a machine that will speak to you in robot speak. It is an overview of Javascript, jQuery, looping and branching. The program takes input from 0 up to a user's selected inputted number and returns all digits in between, replacing a few numbers with text. For example, 7 input turns into [Beep, Boop, 2, "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that", 4, 5, "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that", 7]._

## Known Bugs

_The robot will speak to you but a known bug is that it will only display a variable and not the correct language logic yet. It currently spits out/loops the correct amount of times for its output but it is not pulling the correct language output at this time._
